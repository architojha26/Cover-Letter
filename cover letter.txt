                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I graduated from IIT Indore in May 2022 and have been working as a Software Engineer at NCR Corporation since then. My role on the Analytics Team has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to make a significant impact on our retail software customers by providing actionable insights and analyses.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <p>During my tenure at NCR Corporation, I have successfully developed and implemented several high-impact dashboards focused on Sales, Performance, and Loyalty. My work in creating custom visualizations using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS has not only extended our default Looker components but has also played a crucial role in helping our customers increase their sales by an average of 9% and reduce cashier-level discrepancies by over 20%.</p>
            <p>In addition to my visualization work, I have been involved in implementing cloud functions and developing cloud services for generating receipt images through direct links. These initiatives led to a 30% improvement in user experience ratings and a 40% reduction in paper receipts, aligning with our sustainability goals. My participation in the NCR Hackathon, where we developed a chatbot for expedited business intelligence access, further showcases my ability to leverage GCP’s natural language processing and interact with Big Query. Our team’s success in being among the top 10 at the regional level was a testament to our innovative approach and technical prowess.</p>
